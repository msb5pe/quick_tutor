Welcome to our site, Question Connection! As the title implies, we aid students that need help in classes at UVA to 
connect to tutors that may be able to answer whatever questions they might have.

You can login via the button on the landing page or the menu item "Login" on the top right of the screen.
Once you login you'll be directed to fill out your profile, the personal information you add will allow people to contact you.
You'll then be directed to a screen asking whether you want to be a tutor or get tutored.
In both routes you'll be asked to input the department and class you're interested in and your current location.
    - As a Tutor
        You'll find yourself at a notification center filtered by the class(es) you picked. You can see all students
        currently needing tutoring in that area. If you are interested in accepting a tutor request you can click "accept".
        This will give you a pop-up of with information including their phone number-- you will then be able to contact 
        them and set up how and where the meeting will take place. 
    - As a Student
        After putting in the class you need help in, you can sit back, relax and wait for a tutor to contact 
        you via your phone number!
